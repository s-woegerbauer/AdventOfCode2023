# AdventOfCode2023

Advent Of Code is knocking on the door... (I know it's a bit early xD)  
This is the first version of the preset I will be using! :D

Breakdown of the days:

1.
    - Part 1: Easy solution by one foreach loop
    - Part 2: Got stuck on the overlapping, used a bit of a complicated solution
    - Overall: Could have been way better:
        - 5 min -> 2202
        - 32 min -> 3651

2.
    - Part 1: Got stuck a bit on parsing, which took me ten minutes, I also did not understand the task at first.
    - Part 2: Just changed 1 line of code (40 sec.)
    - Overall: Parsing could have been way better, pretty happy with part 2 though:
        - 17 min -> 3729
        - 18 min -> 2542

3.
    - Part 1: I just had too many errors, which i could not find, so I restarted from the beginning, which costed
      approximately 40 min :(
    - Part 2: Just had to change the LINQ statement, took about 3 min
    - Overall: Part 1 was just terrible, Part 2 was easy, but did not help much
        - 58 min -> 6693
        - 60 min -> 4288

4.
    - Part 1: 51 minutes, nothing more to say
    - Part 2: 8 minutes, at least something
    - Overall: Bad Part 1, Good Part 2
        - 51 min -> 13453
        - 59 min -> 9067

5.
    - Part 1: Had a bit of trouble parsing the input and mapping it.
    - Part 2: Tried to brute force it at first, didn't run fast enough, so I had to write it from the beginning
    - Overall: Hard day, bad solution -> bad day :(
        - 73 min -> 9417
        - 275 min -> 9557

6.
    - Part 1: Didn't understand the task correctly at first.
    - Part 2: Nothing special ...
    - Overall: Solid
        - 32 min -> 9503
        - 39 min -> 8832

7.
    - Part 1: Tried to sort it by ascii first, because I didn't read carefully.
    - Part 2: Just had to change a few things for the joker, because of the good base from part 1.
    - Overall: Pretty Happy with my solution
        - 46 min -> 5092
        - 51 min -> 2700
